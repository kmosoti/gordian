# Coordinator review log

What the coordinator checked for each merged unit, what it decided, and what it carried forward
to later units. Newest first. Reports from workers are model output; this log records what was
independently verified.

## A1 small world — merged

**Re-verified.** Acceptance commands rerun on the branch and on merged main: 67 tests with all
features, clippy with warnings denied, oracle guard, dump sha256 identical across runs and across
the lockfile regeneration (`8be119bf…51fe2`).

**Independent check.** Plug-in mutual information between the true fault kind and coarse public
views of the stream (signal set, signal count, counter abnormality pattern, message severities),
3,000 episodes per class for Ambiguous, FeedbackBait, StaleMemory and JointlyDecisive, against
50 permutation baselines. No view exceeded its baseline. Ordered-sequence views had too many
distinct values for this test to discriminate; the worker's same-seed kind-swap test covers that
case by construction. Not checked: higher-order statistics, timing side channels in code.

**Accepted with notes.**

- Truth priors inside ambiguity sets are non-uniform (Ambiguous: ConfigDrift 40%,
  ResourceExhausted 40%, CredentialExpired 20%; JointlyDecisive 60/40). A learned policy can
  exploit this. It is a property of the environment distribution, not leakage, but B4 must
  report effective ambiguity, and A5 components must not bake the generator's priors in.
- JointlyDecisive defeats one-step selection on the decision value but not entropy-based
  information gain over (kind, bit) worlds. That distinction is itself testable in EXP-002.
- Core stays dependency-free; world keeps its serde shims (`BudgetSpec`, `CostSummary`). Revisit
  only if the shims cause a bug.

**Carried forward.**

- To A4: `Episode` derives `Serialize` including hidden state. Never serialize an `Episode` into
  any channel a policy can read. The recorder writes the public stream and the evaluator's
  verdict, not the episode.
- To A5: an empty `consistent_hypotheses` set means a bounded window dropped evidence, not a
  contradictory world.
- To A2: score from `(Truth, trajectory)` rather than `Episode`, so hand-written fixtures stay
  independent of the generator.

## A7 analysis — merged after one revision

**Re-verified.** 120 tests with `-W error`; no build artefacts committed.

**Revision requested and delivered.** The first submission could not test the charter's
EXP-001 cost measure (a ratio of totals) and could label a tiny sample "equivalent" with only a
warning. Added: paired-bootstrap ratio of totals with a threshold decision; a preregistered
sample-size gate forcing `unresolved` below plan, raw category still shown.

**Accepted with a hard follow-up.** The percentile bootstrap on the ratio is anti-conservative on
skewed costs (7–12% false exceedance at nominal 5%). Recorded as plan item A7b; EXP-001 may not be
frozen until it passes.

## A3 cost bill — merged

**Re-verified.** 39 tests; read `charge_recorded` and `replay`: a charge is applied only after
both budget acceptance and ledger append succeed, and replay uses the same atomic path.

**Carried forward to A4.**

- Build a `Bill` only from a fresh `Budget`. A pre-spent budget silently breaks
  sum-over-phases = total.
- Keep exactly one `Bill` per `Ledger`. `Bill::replay` folds every Accounting entry it finds.

## Process note

One coordinator merge (A7) hit a `.gitignore` conflict; a non-fail-fast command chain then
committed the conflicted tree locally. It was caught before push and repaired. Coordinator
merges now run under `set -euo pipefail`.
